- 👋 Hi, I’m @dev-ton located in Germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in modern UI, sophisticated UX, JAMstack architecture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, GSAP, GraphQL, GatsbyJS and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on UIs - if I can use my CSS skills on any project, that would be cool.
- 📫 How to reach me : tony@stellarcode.io
